AI Bulk Translator for Excel
A modern Office Add-in for Microsoft Excel that bulk-translates selected cell ranges or entire workbooks using the Google Gemini API.

This add-in is designed for users who work with large datasets and need to quickly localize multilingual documents. Thanks to its smart features, it can safely and efficiently translate thousands of rows without hitting the free API limits of Google.

‚ú® Features
Comprehensive Translation: Translate selected cells or all sheets in a workbook with a single click.

Flexible Output Options: Choose between overwriting the existing data ("Replace in Place") or exporting the translations to a brand new sheet while preserving all formatting ("Translate to New Sheet").

Google AI Support: Allows selection between Gemini Flash (optimized for free-tier usage) and Gemini Pro models.

Smart Batching: An intelligent system that processes large files by considering both cell count and character limits to work efficiently within API constraints.

Resilient Error Handling: Features an "exponential backoff" mechanism that automatically waits and retries when API rate limits (429 errors) are exceeded, complete with a visual countdown timer.

Caching System: Caches translations within the current session to avoid re-querying the API for the same text, increasing speed and preserving API quota.

Modern UI: A clean and user-friendly interface designed with Google Material Design, featuring both light and dark theme support.

Data Safety: Protects your original data by displaying any potential API errors in the status bar instead of writing them into the cells.

Additional Functionality: Includes a feature to translate the name of the active sheet.
